🌟 Situation

AtliQ Hardware wanted a unified dashboard to track and understand business performance across various departments. Their existing reports lacked alignment with evolving strategic goals, especially in measuring performance against targets.

✅ Task

The objective was to build a scalable and interactive BI solution that not only compared actuals with previous years but also helped stakeholders assess progress against set targets. Additionally, it was important to create department-specific dashboards that could enable data-driven decision-making.

🛠️ Action

We developed "Business Insights 360", a suite of Power BI dashboards that:

Ingested and transformed data using SQL, Power Query, and Data Flows.

Leveraged DAX and DAX Studio for complex metrics and optimization.

Used SharePoint and Microsoft Fabric for seamless data access and management.

Incorporated feedback loops with stakeholders to iteratively improve and refine the dashboards.

A key turning point came when we realized that comparing with past performance wasn't enough—the business needed visibility into goal attainment. This insight led to redesigning several visuals and KPIs to better reflect target vs actual performance. This experience highlighted the importance of asking the right questions to align technical outputs with business expectations.

📈 Result

The final dashboards empowered AtliQ Hardware’s leadership with:

Department-specific insights for Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive decision-making.

Improved forecasting accuracy, inventory planning, and cost optimization.

Greater clarity on performance gaps and areas needing strategic focus.

🔍 Key Insights

• Net Sales grew ~350% (FY 2022), but Net Profit % remained negative due to high expenses.
• APAC led in Net Sales; however, North America had the highest subregional sales with only ~5% market penetration in the PC division.
• Flat discounting was hurting Gross Margins — indicating a need for performance-based discounting.
• Supply chain issues led to stockouts in FY 2021–2022, followed by excess inventory.
• Sales peaked from September to December — pointing to the need for optimized inventory planning.
• High marketing costs in the UK and Germany required a strategic review.

📝 Recommendations

• Introduce performance-based discounting by product and customer.
• Expand presence in APAC, especially India.
• Integrate real-time forecasting tools to reduce stock imbalances.
• Review and optimize marketing spend in the UK and Germany.
• Align inventory and promotions with peak seasonal demand (Sep–Dec).
